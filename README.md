# SortingSim
>Implementation of a couple of sorting algorithms with wisual representation of them working
## Basic informations
The aplication is beeing hosted on [ghpages](https://lulek1410.github.io/SortingSim/).<br/>
In the programe there are 5 sorting algorithm implementations available:
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Shaker/Coctail sort
* Gnome sort
Aplication allows user to set the deley betwean each algorithm step to better see how the algorithm works.
User is also able to pause the algorithm in orger to change the delay if it is too slow. The available data set can be shuffled.
## Technology used
* React
* Typescript
* Vite
* Redux-toolkit
